          <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>The Mahindra Scorpio is an iconic SUV manufactured by Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. It was the first SUV from the company built for the global market. The Scorpio has been successfully accepted in international markets across the globe. The Scorpio was conceptualized and designed by the in-house integrated design and manufacturing team of Mahindra. The car has been the recipient of three prestigious Indian awards: the "Car of the Year" award from Business Standard Motoring as well as the "Best SUV of the Year" and the "Best Car of the Year" awards, both from BBC World Wheels. On September 21, 2008, Mahindra launched their latest Scorpio with a 6-speed automatic transmission gearbox. Mahindra upgraded their Scorpio Getaway which they launched in Australia in mid-2009. It received additional safety features to the Indian model such as ABS brakes and airbags in an attempt to raise its rating to a minimum of 3 stars from the current 2 star ANCAP rating. The 2012 model scored 6.6 points out of a possible 16, giving it a 3-star ANCAP rating. The 3rd gen of the Scorpio was launched on 25 September 2014 with redesigned front and rear fascias and a new dashboard. A revised automatic variant of the Scorpio was launched in 2015. Mahindra has also for a while had plans on exporting to the United States, possibly with a diesel-electric hybrid. In 2006, it entered into an agreement with Global Vehicles USA to import and distribute Mahindra vehicles. It originally planned to release a modified pick-up version of the Scorpio, named Appalachia in the U.S. by the end of 2009, but legal problems have pushed back its entry into the U.S. market. This vehicle was projected to cost in the low $20,000s.</p>

          <h4>Heritage</h4>
          <p>Prior to the mid-1990s, Mahindra was an automobile assembly company. The company manufactured Willys Jeeps and its minor modified versions, with modifications carried out in India. In 1996, the company planned to enter the SUV segment with a new product which could compete globally. Since Mahindra did not have the technical knowhow to handle such an ambitious product, they devised an entirely new concept among Indian auto companies. Roping in new executives who had worked in the auto industry in western countries, such as Pawan Goenka and Alan Durante, the company broke the rule that says automakers must design, engineer and test their own vehicles while spending millions of dollars in the process. The new Mahindra Scorpio SUV had all of its major systems designed directly by suppliers, with the only inputs from Mahindra being design, performance specifications and program cost. The design and engineering of the systems were carried out by suppliers, as well as testing, validation and materials selection. Sourcing and engineering locations were also chosen by suppliers. The parts were later assembled in a Mahindra plant under the Mahindra badge, being a well-known brand in India. Using this method, the company was able to build from scratch a new vehicle with virtually 100 percent supplier involvement from concept to reality, at a cost of Rs 600 crore, or 6 billion ($120 million), including improvements to the plant. The project took five years to move from concept to final product. The cost was estimated in 2002 to be Rs 550 crore. The Mahindra Scorpio was launched in India in 2002. Soon after the success of the Scorpio, Mahindra launched an upgraded Scorpio with plush seats and rear centre arm rest, dual tone exterior color and various minor changes. In April 2006, the company launched an upgraded Scorpio, dubbing it the 'All-New' Scorpio. At the Auto Expo 2006 in Delhi, Mahindra also showcased their future plans on the Scorpio model by showcasing a hybrid Scorpio with CRDe engine and a Scorpio based on a pickup truck . The hybrid, the first such vehicle developed in India, was developed by Arun Juara, a former employee of Ford. His senior, Pawan Goenka, a former engineer at GM, heads Mahindra's automotive division and oversees the Scorpio project. In June 2007, Mahindra launched a pick-up version in India known as the Scorpio Getaway.</p>
