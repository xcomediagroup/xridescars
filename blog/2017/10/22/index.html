          <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>The Škoda Superb is a mid-size/executive sedan that has been produced by the Czech car manufacturer Škoda Auto since 2001. The third generation Superb, which is using the VW MQB platform, was announced in February 2015 in time for the Geneva Motor Show, with volume production intended to start in the middle of the year. The new model is larger than the second generation. The Škoda Superb appeared in the Tour de France as a Referee car. In the UK, the trim levels available were named the S, SE, SE Technology, SE L Executive, SportLine and Laurin & Klement, with Laurin & Klement being top of the range. The European market receives Active, Ambition, Business, Style, SportLine, GreenLine and Laurin & Klement. The Indian market receives the models Style, and Laurin & Klement. In the United Kingdom, price ranges from £19,060, to the L&K trim with all equipment for £42,385. In most European Countries, pricing ranges from €21435 to €47665. In India, due to the taxes, prices range from 2.6 million to 3.1 million Indian Rupees, or 26 to 31 lakh rupees. The Superb received very positive reviews in all foreign tests. British newspaper The Telegraph rated the new Superb with an overall rating of 9/10, Autocar 4/5, Top Gear 8/10, Auto Express 5/5, and in the German magazine Auto Bild, the Superb received 588 points. The Superb has also scored highly in Australia, where Car Advice awarded an overall rating of 9/10 highlighting key areas of value for money, features, performance and cabin space where the car has excelled. The Superb also defeated its rivals, in AutoBild test the Mercedes-Benz E-Class (E220 CDI) and in Auto Express the Volkswagen Passat 2.0 TDI. The Škoda Superb was also awarded the title of Car of the Year in the Czech Republic and in Macedonia. It also became the 2016 World Car of the Year finalist, the best compact executive car and estate car in 2016 on “What Car?” which is the UK’s leading car buying website and the Auto Express Family Car of the Year 2016.</p>

          <h4>Heritage</h4>
          <p>The first generation of the modern Škoda Superb used the Volkswagen Group B5 PL45+ platform from the 1999 Shanghai–Volkswagen Passat B5 LWB, whose wheelbase is 10 cm (3.9 in) longer than the standard Passat B5. In 2005, Shanghai Volkswagen imported the Superb B5, rebadging it as the Volkswagen Passat Lingyu In 2009, one year after Škoda Superb B5 had been discontinued in Europe, the facelifted SVW Passat Lingyu was unveiled in China. In 2011, SVW Passat Lingyu was discontinued, succeeded by SVW Passat NMS. Several petrol and diesel internal combustion engines are shared with the rest of the Volkswagen Group range; and like the B5 Passat and B6/B7 Audi A4 which use the same automobile platform, they are mounted at the front, and orientated longitudinally. The Superb received a minor facelift in August 2006 incorporating Škoda's new radiator grille, headlights, side repeater indicators integrated into the door mirrors, and C-shaped tail lights in the style of Škoda Roomster and latest Škoda Octavia. An interior redesign completed the upgrades. A 'Laurin and Klement' model became the top of the range, replacing the 'Elegance' model. A range of new engines was introduced and the interior featured real wood as part of some trim levels. The 'Comfort', 'Elegance' and 'Laurin & Klement' models feature an umbrella stowed in the rear door panel. Škoda considered an estate version of the Superb, but it never proceeded to production. The reason it wasn't put in production was that Volkswagen feared that an estate would take too much market share from its own Passat Variant and Audi's A6 Avant. When the Superb was released in the United Kingdom, the most expensive variant was priced at only about $1,600 more than the cheapest Jaguar X-Type. An all new Škoda Superb (B6, Typ 3T) was unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show in early March 2008. Based on a stretched version of the latest A5 Octavia platform, the Volkswagen Group A6 PQ46, this Superb is a five door five seat liftback, with an innovative rear door that can double as a regular separate sedan trunk, and full liftback, known as ‘Twindoor'. Being based on the Octavia A5 platform, this Superb now uses a transverse engine layout. A Superb Combi – five door estate with 633 litres in the boot – was presented to the press in June 2009, and debuted at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 2009. Trim levels available in the majority of Europe were named the Comfort, Ambition, Elegance, Greenline, Exclusive and Laurin & Klement (May 2012) – with Laurin & Klement being top of the range. In the United Kingdom, the levels available were S, SE, Elegance, 'Laurin & Klement' and ‘Greenline’. The Indian Market got only Ambition and Elegance. For the Superb was available extensive list of standard and extras, incl. bi xenon headlamps with AFS, front/rear proximity sensors, automatic park assist system, tyre pressure monitoring system, navigation system with large 6.5" touch screen display and 30 GB hard drive, television broadcast receiver, electrically adjustable seat and mirrors, rain sensor, sunroof with solar panels that allow circulation of air in parked car, front/rear heated seats, ventilated front seats upholstered in leather. For the Superb Combi a large tilt/slide two piece panoramic sunroof was an option. In April 2013, Škoda unveiled a facelifted Superb in Shanghai. It was released for sale in the European market in June 2013. Updated exterior design features Škoda new design language elements. Headlights are fitted with integrated LED daylight running lights; diodes are standard for tail lights, too. The Twindoor opening mechanism was changed in order to provide easier operation: one button opens just the lid, while the other opens whole tailgate. Up to now, one button was dedicated just for opening, while the other had shifting function. With the facelift, a combination of all wheel drive and DSG automatic transmission appeared on offer for the 125 kW two litre diesel engine. Starting from January 2014, design Outdoor package is available for the Superb Combi. List of feature was slightly expanded, too. Facelifted Superb received latest generation of Automatic Parking Assistant: add to parallel parking for entering/exiting the spot, the system is also capable of perpendicular parking for entering the spot. From now on, the passengers in the rear seats can adjust the passenger seat from the back. The electrical control is located on the side of the passenger seat near the centre console and is thus easy to operate from the back. Passengers in the rear can move the front seat forward and back and adjust the seat height and angle.</p>
