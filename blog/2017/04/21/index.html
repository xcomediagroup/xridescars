          <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>The Lamborghini Huracán is Lamborghini's major V10 Supercar to date. It looks great, it sounds great, and much more. It is super fast too. The speed is unbelieveable.</p>

          <h4>Heritage</h4>
          <p>The Huracán has got some great heritage to it. The original Lamborghini in this series is the Urraco which was produced from 1973 to 1979. Each car had a V8, with the fastest version using a 3 liter V8, with a 0-60 in 5.6 seconds which was fast at the time. During the Urraco’s production also came the Lamborghini Silhouette, which was produced from 1976 to 1979, which is very rare as only 54 were produced. After both of those were complete, the Lamborghini Jalpa came in production in 1980. That was powered by a 3.5 Liter V8 and had a 5-speed manual transmission. It was a targa, which is a car with a manually removable hardtop. The Jalpa was produced from 1981 to 1988 and only a total of 410 Jalpas were produced. The Jalpa was actually the last Lamborghini to ever have a V8 engine in it, because then there was a 15 year delay for the successor to the Jalpa. The successor to the Jalpa was the Gallardo. The Gallardo had a 10 year production time, with one facelift. The original Gallardo had a 5 Liter V10 having 513 horsepower, and came in many variations. There of course was the main Coupé and Spyder, but also there was the Superleggera, which had produced 10 more horsepower, making it 523 hp. There is the very rare Police edition car, which those had been donated to state police in Europe, and there was the Gallardo SE, which was limited to 250 units which had unique styling to it. There also was the Gallardo Nera Edition which had more unique styling to it. That edition was limited to 185 units total. About the 1st 1500 Gallardo were recalled to steering fluid leaking and risk of fire, which had been fixed. The original Superleggera is rare because only a total of 618 were made during production. In 2008, Lamborghini introduced the new facelift, which became the LP560-4, which had a new 5.2 Liter V10 producing 552hp. The new Spyder came later in the year. In March 2010, they announced the new LP570-4 Superleggera, which had produced 562 horsepower, and in 2011, they introduced the Spyder version, the Performante. In 2010, they had introduced the LP550-2 Gallardo, which was the rear wheel drive version, which produced 543hp. Lamborghini also donated two of their facelift cars to Police, and then in 2010, their first special edition was the LP550-2 Balboni, paying tribute to their former test driver, Valentino Balboni, which was limited to 250 units. The Bicolore then came out, all limited to 250 units only available in orange, yellow, grey, white, or blue. Another limited production car was the tricolore edition. Then came the LP570-4 Super Trofeo Stradale, which was also limited to only 250 units. The Huracan then came. First the LP610-4 Coupe, producing 602 horsepower. In 2016 then came the Spyder and LP580-2 Coupe and Spyder, and now in 2017, comes the LP640-4 Performante. Also there was a Huracan Avio edition limited to 250 units.</p>

          <h4>Review</h4>
          <p>The Hurácan is such an amazing car! I had the opportunity to do a full review of this car and wow it was a lot of fun. The ride was great and fun, but also its feel inside was a whole lot different than I thought. It felt a lot more real in person than even on pictures and videos.</p>
