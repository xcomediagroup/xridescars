          <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>The W211 E-Class seen here was revealed at the 2002 Brussels Motor Show, and the design of the 2002 E-Class evolved the lines of its predecessor, while maintaining the distinctive twin-headlight that initiated the W210 Mercedes-Benz design trend when it first arrived in 1995. In the new design, the twin-headlight had been angled back slightly. The 2002 E-Class was larger than any of its predecessors while managing to offer less interior space, particularly in the estate version, than the W210 it replaced. It offered gasoline or diesel engines with a choice of rear or 4-wheel drive. Mercedes-Benz claimed to have reduced the fuel consumption of the new E-Class by up to 0.9 litres per 100 km compared with the outgoing model though the official figures for some models were worse than the predecessor. The on-board computer of the W211 was more accurate than that of the W210 as it took into account stationary periods: consequently the W211 showed consumption of 7 to 10 mpg worse. In fact the cars use roughly the same amount of fuel. The redesigned 2002 model set new standards in the areas of vehicle safety, comfort and handling dynamics, including the electrohydraulic braking system Sensotronic Brake Control (SBC), which was standard equipment in the E-Class, as well as the multicontour seat and the AIRMATIC DC (Dual Control) air suspension system. The multicontour seat automatically adapts to the current driving situation, while the air suspension uses microelectronics to control both springing and damping. Airmatic was standard equipment in the top-of-the-range E500 V8 model and was available as an option on all other E-Class models. The W211 is a more complex car than its predecessor and arguably better engineered with a programmable serial bus and many automated systems of which the driver will not usually be aware. This was consistent with the Mercedes Benz cultures of continual improvement and passive safety. The adaptive suspension and gearbox settings combine to make the car noticeably tauter when driven at speed on country roads. As beneficial as that is for the driver, it comes at the cost of passenger comfort. The E55 AMG was unveiled in September 2002 at the Paris Motor Show. It debuted as the fastest production sedan in the world. The E55 AMG was also offered in an estate version for later model years. The E55 AMG is powered by the M113 ML55 engine, a 5.4 L V8 with a Lysholm type supercharger manufactured by IHI. The E55's engine was rated at 476 PS (350 kW; 469 hp) and 700 N·m (520 lb·ft). The reality however was that the E55 was actually tuned to 500 PS (370 kW; 490 hp) from the factory just as the S55 AMG. Mercedes' 469 hp number was part of the marketing strategy to differentiate the more expensive S55 AMG from the E55 AMG. Only the SL55 has more power due to a larger throttle body. There was a facelift later on with extra features and a new E63 with Naturally Aspirated engine, and then a W212 and now W213, which that does have extra quality features, but still the W211 is quite a well known vehicle on the market.</p>

          <h4>Heritage</h4>
          <p>The original vehicle of this class was the 170, and it was produced from 1933 to 1936, with about 17000 units produced, all of which were made in Stuttgart in Germany. After that came the W136, which over 150000 units were made, which were about 70000 prior to World War II, and 80000 after those times. 1953 came the Mercedes-Benz W120, which technically started as the E-Class Series, and in 1956, the W121 came. Often referred to as Pontons, the pair were the main stay of Mercedes’s lineup during their production runs. Together, with the more luxurious and somewhat larger 2.2 liter inline 6 Mercedes-Benz W128, they constituted 80% of Mercedes’ population between 1953 and 59. Next came the W110, replacing the W120, as the first series came in 1961, and the second series came in 1965. In 1968, replacing the W110 came the W114, which has been in production for 8 years and nearly two million of those have been built. Thee also was a related W116 for the time. The W123 after that, had sold more than 2.6 million cars. Next came the W124, which is when E-Class got its name. In 1984, the vehicle started production, and in 1993, the name became E-Class. It was produced as the E-Class until 1995, when the W210 came out. The W210 was produced from 1995 to 2003, and also was the very first AMG E-Class. And it had been the E36 AMG, which only 49 units were made. </p>
